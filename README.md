By Thomas Kas


## Usage (currently Windows-only)

- Ensure you have Rustup installed
- Run the batch file from a terminal

It can instead be run using the batch file (Windows-only), which installs the correct toolchain and dependencies and runs the project.
This batch file asks you what program you want to analyze.
